# ARules-emplyee-attrition
Implemented Apriori Association rules mining algorithm to analyze emplyee_attrition
Analyze employee_attrition.csv dataset. This dataset provides a variety of information about employees, such as demographics, time on job, etc. and also if they stay with or leave the company(as in binary attribute “Attrition” with No means stay and Yes means leaving).
Utilize the CRISP-DM process
Data preprocessing, cleaning, transformation: potential data quality issues and properly address those issues as part of data preparation.
exploratory data analysis (EDA): descriptive statistics and apply data visualization to check for interesting data patterns.
Run association rule mining algorithm using default settings as a baseline model.
Fine tune the model by experimenting with different algorithm hyper-parameters and discuss how tuning those hyper-parameters could impact the model performance (e.g. overfitting or underfiting).
Output and present the most interesting and significant rules which could predict “Attrition”; print out the top 5 rules which predict those who stay vs. who leave, respectively.
Provide interpretations of the above chosen association rules and also discuss why you consider them interesting and significant.
